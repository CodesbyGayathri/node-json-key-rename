Data normalization: Rename API response keys to match your application's expected format.
Consistency: Ensure consistent naming conventions across different data sources.
Refactoring: Cleanly refactor your codebase by renaming object keys without manually editing every instance.

## Installation

To install this package, use npm:

```bash
npm install json-key-rename
```


### Installation

Here's how you can use this package to rename keys in JSON:

```bash
const renameJsonKeys = require('json-key-rename');

const jsonData = {
  firstName: 'Alice',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    postalCode: '12345',
  }
};

// Define the new key values for the keys to be renamed
const newKeys = {
  firstName: 'givenName',
  lastName: 'surname',
  street: 'streetAddress',
  city: 'cityName',
  postalCode: 'zipcode',
};

const renamedData = renameJsonKeys(jsonData, newKeys);
console.log(renamedData);
```
Output:
```bash

{
  givenName: 'Alice',
  surname: 'Smith',
  address: {
    streetAddress: '123 Main St',
    cityName: 'Anytown',
    zipcode: '12345',
  }
}
```
## For Frameworks like Angular

```bash
import {renameJsonKeys} from 'json-key-rename';
```

```bash
const jsonData = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const newKeys = { a: 'x', b: 'y' };

const renamedJson = renameJsonKeys(jsonData, newKeys);

console.log('Renamed Object:', renamedJson);
```
